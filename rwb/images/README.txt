The images in this directory need to be converted to base64 and
placed in the __init__.py file. img2data.py will do that for you.
When you run that script it will convert all the images and 
overwrite the existing __init__.py file. 

Images in this directory are from the Silk icon set which was
created by Mark James. The icons are provided under the Creative
